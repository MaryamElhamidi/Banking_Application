# Banking Application ‚Äì Object-Oriented Design

**Creator:** Maryam Elhamidi
**Date:** November 20, 2023

## üìå Project Overview

This is a console-based banking system developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It supports the creation and management of different types of accounts ‚Äî specifically, Savings and Chequing accounts. Users can interact with their accounts by performing deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

## üß± Class Structure & Relationships

| Class             | Purpose                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Account`         | Base class for shared account attributes and methods                       |
| `SavingsAccount`  | Inherits from `Account`; enforces minimum balance during withdrawals       |
| `ChequingAccount` | Inherits from `Account`; allows overdrafts up to a defined limit           |
| `Bank`            | Manages all accounts, handles account creation and lookup                  |
| `Application`     | Main interface for user interaction, links menu options to account actions |

### UML (Text Description)

* `Bank` **has-a** list of `Account`
* `SavingsAccount` and `ChequingAccount` **is-a** `Account`
* `Application` **uses-a** `Bank`

## üöÄ Features

* Preloaded accounts for testing
* Open new savings or chequing accounts
* Deposit and withdraw money
* View account balance
* Account number validation and generation
* Error handling and input validation

## üõ† How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaryamElhamidi/A3_Repository.git
   cd A3_Repository
   ```
2. Ensure all required `.py` files (`Bank.py`, `Account.py`, etc.) are in the same directory.
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python Application.py
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Error Handling

* Invalid inputs are caught using `try/except` blocks.
* Invalid account types prompt re-entry.
* Runtime errors are handled gracefully with descriptive messages.

## ‚ùóLimitations & Future Improvements

* Currently, users can‚Äôt fully customize account details during creation beyond balance and type.
* Limited input validation (e.g., text vs numeric for some fields).
* User interaction relies heavily on preloaded values.
* Future versions will include:

  * Fully user-driven account creation.
  * Editable account fields.
  * Persistent account data storage (file or database).
